13. Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.

C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.

Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand that they are two very different things.

Here is a class written in C#:

class Example { }

Here is a class written in C# that explicitly uses a .NET framework assembly, type, and method:

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Here we call into the .NET framework to 
        // write to the output console
        System.Console.Write("hello, world");
    }
}

As I mentioned before, it is very difficult to use Microsoft's implementation of C# without using the .NET framework as well. Also, the reason I use the phrase Microsoft's implementation of C# is because there are other implementations of C# available.
