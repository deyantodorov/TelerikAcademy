    <p>Problem 1. Planar coordinates</p>
    <p>Write functions for working with shapes in standard Planar coordinate system.</p>
    <p>Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)</p>
    <p>Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))</p>
    <p>Calculate the distance between two points.</p>
    <p>Check if three segment lines can form a triangle.</p>
    <p>See console...</p>
