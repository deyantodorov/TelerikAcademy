1. Write down in a text file all the major similarities and 
differences you can find between ASP.NET Web Forms 
and ASP.NET MVC

**Similarities:**

- both works on .NET and have similar usage of .NET integrated features
- both have similar project file structure
- both have custom data models

**Differences:**

- MVC is cool, but Web Forms is not. 
- In MVC you have control over markup in easy and clear way, but in Web Forms you should use controls. Controls sometimes generate bad html, css and etc.
- In MVC you don't have VIEWSTATE, but in Web Forms you have it and can use it to store data.

Here you could find very nice article and explanation - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/528117/WebForms-vs-MVC.

I don't think that I should rewrite it :)
